## 📚 How It Works  

AstroWaveAlgo is built around a systematic and logical workflow:  

1. **Astro Level Detection**  
   The algorithm begins by identifying key price levels based on astro data (e.g., support and resistance). These levels act as benchmarks to assess the movement of stocks and detect the formation of M and W patterns.  

2. **Pattern Formation**  
   Using historical and live data, the algo identifies W and M patterns, which indicate potential buy or sell opportunities. This formation is validated with volume spikes for higher accuracy.  

3. **SMA Crossovers**  
   The algo monitors SMA (Simple Moving Average) crossovers (5-SMA and 200-SMA) to further validate trend shifts and trigger entry/exit points.  

4. **Live Data Handling**  
   All stock and option data are dynamically fetched from the broker (Kotak Neo) and stored in JSON files for efficient real-time processing.  

5. **Trade Execution & Monitoring**  
   - Trades are executed based on the validated logic.  
   - If a trade isn’t filled within 3 seconds, it is canceled and reattempted with adjustments to ensure execution.  
   - Alerts are triggered in case of errors or abnormalities, notifying the user via email.  

## 🔑 Key Advantages  

- **Astrology Meets Technicals**: Combines two powerful methodologies for trading.  
- **Automation**: Fully automated from data preparation to trade execution.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust system ensures trades are executed efficiently, with fallback mechanisms for errors.  
- **High Precision**: Pattern recognition validated by volume and SMA crossovers for reliable trade signals.

## 📈 Example Trade Workflow  

1. A stock hits a predefined astro level.  
2. The algorithm detects an M or W pattern at this level.  
3. Volume spikes confirm the strength of the pattern.  
4. SMA crossover aligns with the trade direction.  
5. The trade is executed, monitored, and validated in real-time.

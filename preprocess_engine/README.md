### Files  

1. **`give_list_of_stocks.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Identifies all F&O (Futures and Options) stocks within a specific price range (e.g., 2500â€“3500).  
   - **Input**: Requires an input file named `nfourl_data.csv` containing raw stock data.  
   - **Output**: A curated list of stocks that match the specified criteria.  

2. **`make_stock_data.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Extracts essential parameters for stock information, such as option IDs and option names.  
   - **Input**: Utilizes the `nfourl_data.csv` file for data extraction.  
   - **Output**:  
     - `ce_options.json`: Contains data for call options.  
     - `pe_options.json`: Contains data for put options.  
   - **Note**: The options data provided by the broker changes monthly, so the `nfourl_data.csv` file must be updated every month to ensure accuracy.  

3. **`before_running_the_tool.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Prepares the `stock_hub.json` file, which is crucial for the algo to function.  
   - **Details**:  
     - The `stock_hub.json` file stores live stock data, calculations, and key parameters.  
     - Acts as the central input file for the entire algo.
